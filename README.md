In this repository, you'll find some R code to help you learn how to manage biodiversity spatial data. It covers basic knowledge on how to manipulate spatial data such as raster files, shapefiles, and polygons. Youâ€™ll also find basic code to run some statistical analyses and ecological niche models.

1. <b>From GBIF</b>: Download GBIF data using R. [HTML version](https://rpubs.com/oleon12/rgbif) or [PDF version](https://github.com/oleon12/spatialR/blob/main/PDF/R_GBIF.pdf)
2. <b>Check occurrences</b>: Visualize your GBIF data, identify potential errors, crop spatial objects, and save the cleaned dataset. [HTML version](https://rpubs.com/oleon12/checkocc) or [PDF version](https://github.com/oleon12/spatialR/blob/main/PDF/R_Occ_Check.pdf)
3. <b>Spatila Analysis I</b>: A simple but nice spatial analysis with bat diversity in the U.S. [HTML version](https://rpubs.com/oleon12/Spat1) or [PDF version](https://github.com/oleon12/spatialR/blob/main/PDF/R_SpatialStats.pdf)
